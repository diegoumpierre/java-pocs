# Solution
Given a number N, which is the closest prime number (let's call it P), smaller than N, 
and that has a sum of the most consecutive primes that the total is exactly P?

Example:

N= 20
P= 17
Sum= 2+3+5+7

Prime numbers from 1 to 100, for reference:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89 e 97

Example 2: N= 104 P= 101 Sum= 13+17+19+23+29
