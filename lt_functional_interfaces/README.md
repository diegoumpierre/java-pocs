# Functional Interfaces

The purpose for this POC is show examples for functional interfaces introduced in JAVA 8.

In Java 8, there are four categories of functional interfaces in the java.util.function package:
Consumer, Supplier, Function, and Predicate.
A Function converts a single input into a single output. A Predicate converts an input into
 a boolean.

The signatures for the single abstract methods in Consumer and Supplier are essentially
opposites of each other

# Getting Started
You can clone the repository and look on test package to see the examples.
You can debug the tests to see the things working.
